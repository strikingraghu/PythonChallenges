Problem Description
The program takes two numbers and checks if they are amicable numbers.

Problem Solution
1. Take in both the integers and store it in separate variables.
2. Find the sum of the proper divisors of both the numbers.
3. Check if the sum of the proper divisors is equal to the opposite numbers.
4. If they are equal, they are amicable numbers.
5. Print the final result.
6. Exit.

Problem Description
The program takes three sides of a triangle and prints the area formed by all three sides.

Problem Solution
1. Take in all the three sides of the triangle and store it in three separate variables.

Problem Description
The program takes in a number and checks if it is a prime number.

Problem Solution
1. Take in the number to be checked and store it in a variable.
2. Initialize the count variable to 0.
3. Let the for loop range from 2 to half of the number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
4. Then find the number of divisors using the if statement and increment the count variable each time.
