Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number.
(Increment the number represented by the digits)
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.
Example:
If the array has [4, 5, 6] the resultant array should be [4, 5, 7] as 456 + 1 = 457.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases are:
    The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array.
    The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.
Output:
Print the space separated resultant array in a separate line for each case.
Input:
