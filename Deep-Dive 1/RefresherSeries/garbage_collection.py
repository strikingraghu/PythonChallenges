"""
Pythonâ€™s memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic. The user does not have to preallocate or deallocate memory similar to using dynamic memory allocation in languages such as C or C++. 
Python uses two strategies for memory allocation: 

 - Reference counting
 - Garbage collection
