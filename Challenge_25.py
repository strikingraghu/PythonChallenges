"""
This is a Python Program to print prime numbers in a range using Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Problem Description
The program takes a range and prints prime numbers in that range using Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Problem Solution
1. Take the value of n from the user.
2. Initialise the sieve with numbers from 2 to n.
3. Use a while loop with the condition that the sieve is not empty
4. Get the smallest number that is prime
5. Remove that number and itâ€™s multiples
6. Continue till the sieve is empty
7. Exit
